        - eduPersonOrgUnitDN            # The distinguished name(s) (DN) of the directory entries representing the person's Organizational Unit(s). May be multivalued, as for example, in the case of a faculty member with appointments in multiple departments or a person who is a student in one department and an employee in another.
        - eduPersonPrimaryAffiliation   # Specifies the person's primary relationship to the institution in broad categories such as student, faculty, staff, alum, etc. (See controlled vocabulary).
        - eduPersonPrimaryOrgUnitDN     # The distinguished name (DN) of the directory entry representing the person's primary Organizational Unit(s).
        - eduPersonPrincipalName        # A scoped identifier for a person. It should be represented in the form "user@scope" where 'user' is a name-based identifier for the person and where the "scope" portion MUST be the administrative domain of the identity system where the identifier was created and assigned. Each value of 'scope' defines a namespace within which the assigned identifiers MUST be unique. Given this rule, if two eduPersonPrincipalName (ePPN) values are the same at a given point in time, they refer to the same person. There must be one and only one "@" sign in valid values of eduPersonPrincipalName.
        - eduPersonPrincipalNamePrior   # Each value of this multi-valued attribute represents an ePPN (eduPersonPrincipalName) value that was previously associated with the entry. The values MUST NOT include the currently valid ePPN value. There is no implied or assumed order to the values. This attribute MUST NOT be populated if ePPN values are ever reassigned to a different entry (after, for example, a period of dormancy). That is, they MUST be unique in space and over time.
        - eduPersonScopedAffiliation    # Specifies the person's affiliation within a particular security domain in broad categories such as student, faculty, staff, alum, etc. The values consist of a left and right component separated by an "@" sign. The left component is one of the values from the eduPersonAffiliation controlled vocabulary.This right-hand side syntax of eduPersonScopedAffiliation intentionally matches that used for the right-hand side values for eduPersonPrincipalName. The "scope" portion MUST be the administrative domain to which the affiliation applies. Multiple "@" signs are not recommended, but in any case, the first occurrence of the "@" sign starting from the left is to be taken as the delimiter between components. Thus, user identifier is to the left, security domain to the right of the first "@". This parsing rule conforms to the POSIX "greedy" disambiguation method in regular expression processing.
        - eduPersonTargetedID           # A persistent, non-reassigned, opaque identifier for a principal.
